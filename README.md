# 🛍️ Product Clustering Analysis
----------------------------------
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs clustering analysis on a dataset of products. The main objective is to group similar products together based on their features using unsupervised machine learning techniques.

## 📌 Project Overview
---------------------
This notebook focuses on:

Loading and exploring product-related data

Preprocessing and normalizing the data

Applying clustering algorithms (e.g., K-Means)

Evaluating optimal clusters using the Elbow Method

Visualizing the clustered groups

### 📊 Use Cases
------------------
Product categorization

Market segmentation

Recommendation systems

Inventory management

### 🧰 Technologies & Libraries
---------------------------------
Python 3.x

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn

Scikit-learn
